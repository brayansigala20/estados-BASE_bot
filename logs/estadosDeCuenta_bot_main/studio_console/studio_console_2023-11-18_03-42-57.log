[2023-11-18T11:18:24.124Z] : [info]: Selectors: Cannot deserialize the current JSON object (e.g. {"name":"value"}) into type 'System.Collections.Generic.IDictionary`2[System.String,System.String][]' because the type requires a JSON array (e.g. [1,2,3]) to deserialize correctly.
To fix this error either change the JSON to a JSON array (e.g. [1,2,3]) or change the deserialized type so that it is a normal .NET type (e.g. not a primitive type like integer, not a collection type like an array or List<T>) that can be deserialized from a JSON object. JsonObjectAttribute can also be added to the type to force it to deserialize from a JSON object.
